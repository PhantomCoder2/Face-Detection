# Face-Detection
Basic Deep Neural Network implementation to detect faces.
Transfer learning was used in order to train the network and confidence threshold was adjusted to detect faces.
Python libraries were used to access the trained model and start face detection using a small pool of dataset.

Next Objective:
To develop the code to detect faces in a crowd and using a huge dataset in order to compute proper accuracy.
